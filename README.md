The webpage should include:

# Summary:
Overall it was interesting to help Dana build a customized website, however, since it is based on a data set included in data.js file, we are limited to the data available and have not linked the website to a live source.

Recommendation includes further analysis that can enhance the webpage by adding, drop-down lists, click buttons and auto-fillers. This will also help the new-users as a guide to the page.

Also, Latest News section can be added to give highlights to the visitors.
